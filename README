Finance-InteractiveBrokers-SWIG

This module provides Perl connectivity to the InteractiveBrokers market data
and program trading service, using the IB-provided C++ code.  It is primarily
intended to be used with L<POE::Component::Client::InteractiveBrokers>, which
provides a better API, but may be used standalone if desired, by referring
to the IB documentation itself (under L</"SEE ALSO">).

It is a very complex module with an involved build process, and thus you
should read the documentation thoroughly.


PREREQUISITES

You must have the following to build and use this module:

* Finance::InteractiveBrokers::API

    Provides a programmatic means of looking up methods and events in the
    IB API.

* A working build environment

    Capable of compiling C and C++ files, and running 'make'.

* SWIG >= 1.3.36

    The "Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator", capable of building SWIG
    interfaces.  This module has been tested with versions from 1.3.36-2.0.1.

Optional, but highly recommended:

* Alien::InteractiveBrokers

    Installs (downloading if necessary) the InteractiveBrokers API files,
    and provides Perly mechanisms for locating them.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


HOW IT WORKS

The IB API is available as either a set of C++ or Java source code files.
This module builds a library from this, and then runs SWIG (the Simplified
Interface Wrapper and Generator) against it to provide Perl connectivity.

The API consists of several methods, callable from this module, as well
as several events, containing the asynchronous responses from IB to
methods you have called.

In order to catch the events, you must subclass
L<Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::EventHandler>, and override all of
the events therein with your own code to handle their responses (e.g.
save them to a database, or do whatever).

You then pass your $handler into ->new(), and you have complete access
to the IB API, delegated through the C++ library.


SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
